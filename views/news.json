Some ballpark math according to Goldman suggests there is ~20 mmbls remaining over ~5 weeks. In any case, energy equities are surging, aided by the continued jump in WTI which just hit $90 on news that Chinese mega city Chengdu is easing Covid restrictions, while optimism about an end to Covid Zero comes from the Reuters news that Moderna has talked with the Chinese government about supplying COVID-19 vaccines; at the same time, nat gas prices jumped 5.6% as temperatures rise in the US and on the possibility that coal shipments could be disrupted by a rail strike.`,
